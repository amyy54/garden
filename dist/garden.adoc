NAME
----
garden - A tool for orchestrating automated vulnerability scans for small businesses.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*garden* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Garden allows for small businesses to orchestrate the scanning of a
network/server by managing the environments of common scanning tools in an
easy to understand way with Docker.


OPTIONS
-------
*-target*='TARGET_HOST'::
    Sets the target that will be passed to the modules. As of now, the program
    doesn't distinguish what it is, and generally anything can be passed
    through with this identifier. It is expected that the target will be an
    IP address or website.

*-host*='DOCKER_HOST'::
    Sets the specfic docker endpoint to use for running the scan. This can
    be any Docker endpoint supported by the Docker API, along with SSH. While
    the tool can be run just on the host's docker instance, this tool is more
    effective when running on a jumphost. The only requirement is that Docker
    be installed on the jumphost. When using with cloud vendors, be sure to
    set up an instance/container that it points to.

*-context*='DOCKER_CONTEXT'::
    Instead of specifying the endpoint directly, if the jumphost is saved in
    the local docker context, it can be read from there. If DOCKER_HOST and
    DOCKER_CONTEXT are both blank, the currently selected docker context is
    read.

*-modules*='MODULES_DIRECTORY'::
    Sets the directory to search for modules from. Module directories are
    required to possess a meta.json. See module resources below. Defaults to
    ./modules.

*-ignore-hash*::
    Ignores all hash checking for modules. Useful for debugging purposes, but
    ill advised for regular use.

*-output*='REPORTS_DIRECTORY'::
    Sets the directory to place the generated reports/output of the modules
    run. The reports will not go directly in here, but instead another
    directory will be created with a filename representing the time the
    containers started. Reports are documented for the build output from
    Docker, the output from the container, and any error messages that occurred
    with the Docker API.

*-list*::
    Lists all modules in the supplied modules directory. Useful for debugging
    and ensuring that the hashes for the categories were successful.

*-category*='CATEGORIES_TO_LOAD'::
    Sets the categories to be run in this scan. Categories are based on the
    directory names in the main modules directory, as specified with
    *-modules*. Multiple categories may be specified by separating with commas.
    While discouraged, * can be specified as a category, which will execute
    all categories present.

*-single*='MODULES_TO_LOAD'::
    Sets individual modules to be run in the scan. Modules must be specified
    with the category/directory they exist under, for example net/nmap. Any
    individual module(s) executed will be reported under the category "single".
    Multiple individual modules may be specified by separating with commas.

*-modargs*='MODULE_ARGUMENTS'::
    Allows for individual modules to have their own parameters/arguments as
    needed. To set them, you can supply argument with the category/name, then
    the key=value pair. Additional arguments are separated by commas. For
    example: 'net/shodan-api_key=key,web/nuclei-templates=cves'.

*-version*::
    Print the version and exit.

*-v[v]*::
    Verbose logging.
